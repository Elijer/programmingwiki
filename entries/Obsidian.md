# Link to files

To create an internal link, simply type `[[`. This will prompt you with the list of notes you can link to. Use `Up arrow` and `Down arrow` to navigate the suggestion list and `Enter` to select the current highlighted link.

# Link to headings

You can also link to specific headers in files. Start typing a link like you would normally. When the note you want is highlighted, press `#` instead of `Enter` and you'll see a list of headings in that file. Continue typing or navigate with arrow keys as before, press `#`again at each subheading you want to add, and `Enter` to complete the link.
