# What is Bootstrap?
Short answer, it is a CSS-first components library.

But it's a lot of things. I've kind of ignored it for a while now, but it's really just a popular toolkit for developing websites. There are bootstrap themes, but let's ignore those because they don't seem to be the best feature. There are also boostrap icons, similar to font-awesome. Then there are **bootstrap components**, which I think may be the most substantial offering of bootstrap. They will likely  prevent you from re-creating the same basic, modern elements that you tend to expect to *already be there* when creating a website - especially a mobile-first website. "How do I get this simple thing on my website?" Bootstrap might be able to help, wether it's a loading bar, a dropbown, or a navbar. Fun fact, twitter created bootstrap, probably just because they started to get frustrated at creating the same type of basic UI elements over and over again.

IMHO - it's not comprehensive. Like, bootstrap won't solve all or even most of your front-end design problems. You still need to design most of your components and stuff. But it does solve some of them.

# [Bootstrap Components](https://www.educba.com/bootstrap-components/)
1. **Glyphicons**: Icons you can use like this:
`<p><span class = “glyphicons glyphicon-pencil”></span></p>`
Unlike fontawesome, or noun project, they don't give you as many choices, but they cover the essentials very well.

1. **Dropdowns:** mobile responsive dropdowns.
1. **Button Groups:** Makes it easy to create a bunch of nice-looking buttons that are adjacent to one another
1. ** Button dropdowns:** a combination of a button with a dropdown. Very useful for UI.
1. ** Input Groups:** Some nice extra styling power for inputs, allowing you to put lavels in line with each form field, and also to add buttons next to them if you want. This also allows you to connect form elements together. In general, it helps to create sleek, compact inputs.
1. **Navbar**: A very reasonable, default navbar that collapses to a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
1. **Jumbotron**: A common, large, attention grabbing component, often with an image background and a large title as *well* as a "call to action" kind of button.
1. **Alerts** The missing default style of user info messages. They are basically styled to give special messages to the user like "success!" or "error" or "card payment did not go through", and they are pre-styled with emotionally resonant colors that already convey the tone of whatever message you are probably going for.
1. **Progress bars**: for loading or whatever. Pretty normal, white on blue bar you would expect.
1. **Badges**: For displaying extra icons or numbers next to something.
1.  **Pagination**: Pagination


# Into Bootstrap but want more components that you don't have to build yourself?
Me too. I feel like bootstrap has the right idea, but there's so much more that can be done in terms of reusable components, so I want to familiarize myself with other, similar libraries that cover even more ground.[ Here's an article about that.](https://hackr.io/blog/top-bootstrap-alternatives)

I think that CSS libraries are the way -- think about it; a gazillion new websites get created everyday, but the amount of actually novel components and UI devices that need to be created everyday? Not many. Most of the groundwork has been done already. If you have a truly revolutionary UI flow, by all means, create your own amazing wheel that's never been seen before. Otherwise, use all the great ones already lying around for your:
- hamburger menus
- dropdowns
- Autofill maybe?

Like just think, has this likely been made by other people at least a thousand times? If so, look for a component you can start with. If you can't find one, you might consider adding it your your *own* reusable CSS component library that you can eventual publish and share yourself.
